# XamlBrewer.WinUI3.Navigation.Sample
This WinUI 3 Desktop app demonstrates main navigation patterns based on a NavigationView control:
* Programmatically showing and hiding a menu item
* Navigating to a menu item from code behind
* Retrieving the current menu item
* Programmatically adding menu items
* ...

The purpose is to get to know the core classes, so we deliberately stayed away from MVVM and Dependency Injection frameworks/libraries.
